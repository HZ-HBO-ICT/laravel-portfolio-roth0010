<h1 id="welcome">Blog 4: SWOT Analysis</h1>

            This blog is a summary of my strengths and weaknesses, coming straight from the study check I did a few
            months ago. It follows the SWOT format - Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats - to analyse
            one's self.
            That was way back in March 2021 - wow, that was a while ago!

            Strengths: What do you do best? What are your positive traits? I definitely feel that I pay attention to minor details, and work hard when I'm interested and engaged in a project
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Weaknesses: What personality traits may be holding you back in your studies / career? I definitely feel that some forgetfulness and ADHD can mean certain projects go unfinished longer than they should.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Opportunities: How can you turn your strengths / weaknesses into opportunities? I feel like, if I can create a system for reminding myself and keeping tasks in order, I can definitely compensate for my forgetfulness.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Threats:  What obstacles do you face to succeed as a student? Could any of your weaknesses prevent you from succeeding in your studies / career? Living on my own in a foreign country will definitely have its obstacles - having to cook for myself, commute, basically being an adult.
